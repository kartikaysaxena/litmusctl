# Litmusctl Local Development Setup Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the local development setup guide for **`litmusctl`**. This guide will walk you through the steps required to set up and run **`litmusctl`** on your local machine.

## Important Note

Before running **`litmusctl`**, make sure you have a Chaos Centre running. Ensure that the Chaos Centre version is compatible with the **`litmusctl`** version you are using.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- [Go programming language](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version or later)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Kubeconfig - `litmusctl` needs the kubeconfig of the k8s cluster where we need to connect litmus Chaos Delegates. The CLI currently uses the default path of kubeconfig i.e. `~/.kube/config`.

## Clone the Repository

From this

```go

GQLAPIPath = "/api/query"

// Auth server API path
AuthAPIPath = "/auth"
```

To this

```go
// Graphql server API path
GQLAPIPath = "/query"

// Auth server API path
AuthAPIPath = ""
```
